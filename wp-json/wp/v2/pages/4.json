Each one is sourced from local suppliers or, when I\u2019m lucky, found on local beaches before being carefully dried.

Shipping costs and dates will be provided.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Please feel free to get in touch if you are interested in a Wisp &amp; Willows creation or would like a bespoke creation made for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>-Wouter-<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Welcome to Wisp &amp; Willows.
