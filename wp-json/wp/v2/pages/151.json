Founded in 2021, in Aberdeen, my small business specialises in creating handcrafted lamps and illuminated handrails from locally sourced wood. I also make small and functional, but beautiful, home furniture.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All my pieces are handcrafted through a combination of design and intuition. I always seek to preserve the original natural shape of the wood I use and enhance its beauty using natural oils and waxes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The individual pieces each have a story to tell. Each one is sourced from local suppliers or, when I\u2019m lucky, found on local beaches before being carefully dried. The wood I use includes oak, beech, elm, cherry and pine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/www.wispandwillows.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/nggallery_import\/th_IMG_2580-Edit.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-147\" width=\"553\" height=\"369\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wispandwillows.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/nggallery_import\/th_IMG_2580-Edit.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.wispandwillows.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/nggallery_import\/th_IMG_2580-Edit-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.wispandwillows.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/nggallery_import\/th_IMG_2580-Edit-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 553px) 100vw, 553px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text alignwide is-stacked-on-mobile is-vertically-aligned-center\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/www.wispandwillows.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/IMG_2580-Edit-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-125 size-full\"\/><\/figure><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p><\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>If you would like a Wisp &amp; Willows creation, I can deliver it in person within Aberdeen City and Aberdeenshire.
